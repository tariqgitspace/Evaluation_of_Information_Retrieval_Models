Evaluation of Information Retrieval Models

•With given twitter data of 5 different languages, Implemented Information Retrieval Models namely Vector Space, BM25 and Divergence From Randomness(DFR) in Solr followed by analysis of performance of these 3 models in terms of the measure Mean Average Precision (MAP) and subsequently evaluated the results using TREC_EVAL program.
•Later, enhanced the performance of these models by tweaking associated parameters and using advanced query processing techniques like query expansion, query weighting and query translation.
